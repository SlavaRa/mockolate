## How to get Mockolate

Got Git? Awesome, you're allowed in the kitchen. 

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/drewbourne/mockolate.git
{% endhighlight %}
    
Got Subversion? Not quite as awesome, but you can play too.

{% highlight bash %}
$ svn checkout http://svn.github.com/drewbourne/mockolate.git
{% endhighlight %}
    
Need a SWC? It is cooking and will be fully baked shortly.

## Now to make some Mockolate yourself

Once you've got Mockolate, you may need a few other pieces too. 

We're going to use [FlexUnit 4]((http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexunit/FlexUnit) for tests, and a bit of [hamcrest-as3](http://github.com/drewbourne/hamcrest-as3) for matching arguments.
